## Introduction

This first introductive work tries to highlight and recreate the *Itliaian "Right" network*. 
Especially in this period (after the last victory of the Right-wing Coalition), in many case
we heard talking about some *return to Fascism*. But it is really the case? We can say that parties, like Lega or Fratelli d'Italia, are fascist parties?
A way that I figure out to try to solve this *dilemma*, is to analyze the follower network of the Italian Far-right and Right-wings' main Twitter profiles, and see if they share common followers.


## Research Question and Methodology

The main question is: is the Right-wing follower or community truly "fascist"? If so, I think that they would be likely to follow also the *real* Italian Far-right parties and groups. So the main hypothesis is: the ones who follows the Far-right communities and profiles will tend to follow also the Right-wing communities, but not viceversa, so the Right-wing followers will tend to follow only the Right-wing communities and groups.

### Twitter Lists

In order to do so, I create publics list on Twitter, which you can see here:

- Far-right Culture: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1600967243881451521
- Far-right Parties: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1600600462612434969
- Right-wing Culture: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1601188241394237442
- Right-wing Parties: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1601142337874395136

The *Far-right Culture* contains newspaper, cultural associations, communities and musical groups (like "Il Primato Nazionale" newspaper, Presidio Milano or "Hobbit" musical group).  The *Far-right Parties* contains the main parties and their youth movements (Forza Nuova, Lotta Studentesca, Casapuond Italia, Blocco Studentesco, Lealtà Azione, ...). The *Right-wing Culture* contains newspaper, cultural associations and public figure link to that political area (La verità, Buttafuoco, Daniele Capezzone, Nicola Porro, ...). And finally, the *Right-wing Parties* contains the main parties and political figures (Lega, Fratelli d'Italia, Giorgia Meloni, Matteo Salvini, Ignazio La Russa, ...).
One clarification has to be made, due to the limited amount of "real follower" that the Far-right also have in the political elections, not only on social media, I took in my lists also all the local pages that I found of the far-right parties, in order to gain more network to work with, also because, for example, only Lega and Fratelli d'Italia togheter have a network of more than 200.000 follower, each.
So to obtain some usable data I have done this methodological assumption.

### Work Table

The main steps to do to get the data and analyse them:

- Get a Twitter Academic API
- Make the list on Twitter
- Gain the data from Twitter
- Clear and export the data
- First graphical analysis of the data 

## Data and Results
### Raw Data
After obtaining the academic API from Twitter, I started to gain the data using the `rtweet` package. First, using the `lists_members` function, I obtain all the IDs of the memeber of the list and then I `tibble` them in a dataframes.
```{r, message = F, warning = F, eval=FALSE}
# Example for the Far_right Parties list:
library(rtweet)
auth_as('XXX')
far_right_parties = lists_members(
  list_id = "1600600462612434969",
  slug = NULL,
  owner_user = NULL,
  n = 100,
  cursor = "-1",
  token = NULL,
  retryonratelimit = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE,
  parse = TRUE,
)


name_far_right_parties = tibble(far_right_parties$screen_name)

```   
To get all the followers of all the lists' users I firstly convert the `screen_names` in the tibble into a character vector to automatize the process with a general function.
```{r, message = F, warning = F, eval=FALSE}
# Tranform the values in a character vector:
list_fr_culture = c(far_right_culture$screen_name)
``` 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
list_fr_culture[7]
list_fr_culture[12] 

[1] "ddtmilano"    
[1] "PresidioMilano"

# Now it gave use all the Screen-Name of the profiles like single units, now we can automatize the get_follower function with a general function

```  
Now with a general function and `lapply` function we can download all the followers of every single user in the lists.
```{r, message = F, warning = F, eval=FALSE}
# Now we get the follower through rtweet, creating a general function to use:

getAllFollowers <- function (name) { 
    user_follower <- get_followers(name, n=Inf, retryonratelimit = T) 
  # we put inf to get all the followers and retryonratelimit = T to respect automatically the 15 minutes refresh time for the API
    Sys.sleep(1)# we put a system sleep of 1 sec to not overstimulate the server
    return(user_follower) }

follower_fr_culture <- lapply(X = list_fr_culture, FUN = getAllFollowers) 
# We use lapply to repeat the same function on all the profile in the list
```  
After doing this for all the list we obtain four large list with all the followers of the users and we have to transform them in dataframes using the `purr` package.
```{r, message = F, warning = F, eval=FALSE}
library(purrr)

# By using map_dfr from purrr package we can create a single tibble out of the tibbles contained in the large list automatically
df_fr_c <- map_dfr(follower_fr_culture, bind_rows)
df_fr_p <- map_dfr(follower_fr_parties, bind_rows)
df_rw_c <- map_dfr(follower_rw_culture, bind_rows)
df_rw_p <- map_dfr(follower_rw_parties, bind_rows)
```
Then I exported all the *raw dataframes* in the `Data` folder:
```{r, echo= F}
df_fr_c = read.csv("C:\\Users\\39333\\Desktop\\UNIVERSITA\\MAGISTRALE COM-DAPS&CO\\CORSI\\DATA ACCESS AND REGULATIONS\\CAPSTONE PROJECT\\Capstone_Taddei_Ita_Right\\Data\\Raw Followers DF\\RAW follower fr culture.csv")

head(df_fr_c)
```  
So we have four raw dataframes:

- Far-right Culture: 48.897 followers
- Far-right Parties: 124.852 followers
- Right-wing Culture: 295.983 followers
- Right-wing Parties: 317.547 followers

### Data Cleaning
Now we ignore the duplicates, in every dataframe. The idea is to see who are the followers of the four main groups (as they were single users with all the followers) so: Far Right Cultures and Parties, Right-wing Cultures and Parties.
```{r, message = F, warning = F, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

# We specify also the coloumn from_id (wich are the followers)

clean_df_fr_c = df_fr_c %>% distinct(from_id, .keep_all = TRUE)

clean_df_fr_p = df_fr_p %>% distinct(from_id, .keep_all = TRUE)

clean_df_rw_c = df_rw_c %>% distinct(from_id, .keep_all = TRUE)

clean_df_rw_p = df_rw_p %>% distinct(from_id, .keep_all = TRUE)
```
They are also exported as *clean dataframes* in the `Clean Followers DF` sub-folder (in the `Data` folder).
```{r, message = F, warning = F, eval=FALSE}
# We want to create a general dataframe with all the followers, divided by the main group which they refer to:
# First we see how many and which common followers the four main groups share
library(tidyverse)
f_fr_c = clean_df_fr_c %>% 
  mutate(to_id = "frc") %>% 
  add_column(fllw1 = 1) %>% 
  add_column(fllw2 = NA) %>% 
  add_column(fllw3 = NA) %>% 
  add_column(fllw4 = NA)

f_fr_p = clean_df_fr_p %>% 
  mutate(to_id = "frp")%>% 
  add_column(fllw1 = NA) %>% 
  add_column(fllw2 = 1) %>% 
  add_column(fllw3 = NA) %>% 
  add_column(fllw4 = NA)

f_rw_c = clean_df_rw_c %>% 
  mutate(to_id = "rwc")%>% 
  add_column(fllw1 = NA) %>% 
  add_column(fllw2 = NA) %>% 
  add_column(fllw3 = 1) %>% 
  add_column(fllw4 = NA)

f_rw_p = clean_df_rw_p %>% 
  mutate(to_id = "rwp")%>% 
  add_column(fllw1= NA) %>% 
  add_column(fllw2 = NA) %>% 
  add_column(fllw3 = NA) %>% 
  add_column(fllw4 = 1)

tot_followers = rbind(f_fr_c, f_fr_p, f_rw_c, f_rw_p)
colnames(tot_followers) = c("follower_id", "grp", "fllw1", "fllw2", "fllw3", "fllw4")
```
Now we can see how many followers each group has.
![](https://github.com/DataAccess2020/Capstone_Taddei_Ita_Right/blob/main/Plots/Hist_Total_follower.png?raw=true)

As we can see, and as we wrote before, the Far-right area is very limited compared to the Right-wing, also with the methodological coercion that we settled.
Now we want to see how many common and unique followers there are, and what they follow:
```{r, message = F, warning = F, eval=FALSE}
id_follow_grp<- tot_followers %>%  # From the main dataframe
  group_by(follower_id) %>%  # We keep our focus on the follower_id, and group together the same row by the same follower_id
  summarise(fllw1 = sum(fllw1, na.rm = T),
            fllw2 = sum(fllw2, na.rm = T),
            fllw3 = sum(fllw3, na.rm = T),
            fllw4 = sum(fllw4, na.rm = T)) # We sum all the properties of the single follower_id (so if it follows other groups)
colnames(id_follow_grp) = c("follower_id", "frc", "frp", "rwc", "rwp") # Rename columns to be more readable
```
So, now we have a very large dataframe with **447.810 Twitter users** and what groups they follow.
```{r, echo= F}
group_follower = read.csv2("C:\\Users\\39333\\Desktop\\UNIVERSITA\\MAGISTRALE COM-DAPS&CO\\CORSI\\DATA ACCESS AND REGULATIONS\\CAPSTONE PROJECT\\Capstone_Taddei_Ita_Right\\Data\\Total Followers\\Followers properties groups.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
options("scipen"=100, "digits"=4)
head(group_follower)
```
