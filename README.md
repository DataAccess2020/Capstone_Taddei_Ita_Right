# Twitter Fascism in Italy: how people are connected? A project by Federico Taddei
## Introduction

This first introductive work tries to highlight and recreate the *Itliaian "Right" network*. 
Especially in this period (after the last victory of the Right-wing Coalition), in many case
we heard talking about some *return to Fascism*. But it is really the case? We can say that parties, like Lega or Fratelli d'Italia, are fascist parties?
A way that I figure out, trying to solve this *dilemma*, is to analyze the follower network of the Italian Far-right and Right-wings' main Twitter profiles, and see if they share common followers.

## Research Question and Methodology

The main question is: is the Right-wing follower or community truly "fascist"? If so, I think that they would be likely to follow also the *real* Italian Far-right parties and groups. So the main hypothesis is: the ones who follows the Far-right communities and profiles would be more likely to follow also the Right-wing communities, but not viceversa, so the Right-wing followers will tend to follow only the Right-wing communities and groups.

### Twitter Lists

In order to do so, I create publics list on Twitter, which you can see here:

- Far-right Culture: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1600967243881451521
- Far-right Parties: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1600600462612434969
- Right-wing Culture: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1601188241394237442
- Right-wing Parties: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1601142337874395136

The *Far-right Culture* contains newspaper, cultural associations, communities and musical groups (like "Il Primato Nazionale" newspaper, Presidio Milano or "Hobbit" musical group).  The *Far-right Parties* contains the main parties and their youth movements (Forza Nuova, Lotta Studentesca, Casapuond Italia, Blocco Studentesco, Lealtà Azione, ...). The *Right-wing Culture* contains newspaper, cultural associations and public figure link to that political area (La verità, Buttafuoco, Daniele Capezzone, Nicola Porro, ...). And finally, the *Right-wing Parties* contains the main parties and political figures (Lega, Fratelli d'Italia, Giorgia Meloni, Matteo Salvini, Ignazio La Russa, ...).
One clarification has to be made, due to the limited amount of "real follower" that the Far-right also have in the political elections, not only on social media, I took in my lists also all the local pages that I found of the far-right parties, in order to gain more network to work with, also because, for example, only Lega and Fratelli d'Italia togheter have a network of more than 200.000 follower, each.
So to obtain some usable data I have done this methodological assumption.

### Work Flow

The project workflow was so structured:
- Get a Twitter Academic API
- Make the list on Twitter
- Gain the data from Twitter
- Clear and export the data
- First graphical analysis of the data 
- Conclusions
